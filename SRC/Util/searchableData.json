He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the \nlordlings come and go. “Dead is dead,” he said. “We have no business with the dead.”\n“Are they dead?” Royce asked softly. “What proof have we?”\n“Will saw them,” Gared said. “If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me.”\nWill had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had \nbeen later rather than sooner. “My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,” he put \nin.\n“My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,” Royce replied. “Never believe anything you \nhear at a woman’s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.” His voice \nechoed, too loud in the twilit forest."

And night \nis falling.”\nSer Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. “It does that every day about this \ntime. Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?”\nWill could see the tightness around Gared’s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his \neyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night’s \nWatch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more \nthan that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. \nYou could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.\nWill shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been \nsent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to \nwater. He had laughed about it afterward."

Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that \nmade his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then \nnorth again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling \nraiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the \nworst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like \nliving things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something \ncold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so \nmuch as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share \nwith your commander.\nEspecially not a commander like this one."

He \nwas a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. \nMounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their \nsmaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, \nand a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled \nleather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch for less than half a \nyear, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his \nwardrobe was concerned.\nHis cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. “Bet he killed \nthem all himself, he did,” Gared told the barracks over wine, “twisted their little heads \noff, our mighty warrior.” They had all shared the laugh.\nIt is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat \nshivering atop his garron."

I don’t like this weather. If it \nsnows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow’s the best we can hope for. Ever \nseen an ice storm, my lord?”\nThe lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-\nbored, half-distracted way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to \nunderstand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. “Tell me again \nwhat you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.”\nWill had been a hunter before he joined the Night’s Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. \n\nMallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters’ own woods, skinning \none of the Mallisters’ own bucks, and it had been a choice of putting on the black or \nlosing a hand."

There’s eight of them, men and women both. No children I could \nsee. They put up a lean-to against the rock. The snow’s pretty well covered it now, but I \ncould still make it out. No fire burning, but the firepit was still plain as day. No one \nmoving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still.”\n“Did you see any blood?”\n“Well, no,” Will admitted.\n“Did you see any weapons?”\n“Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel \npiece of iron. It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.”\n“Did you make note of the position of the bodies?”\nWill shrugged. “A couple are sitting up against the rock.

Frostfallen leaves whispered \npast them, and Royce’s destrier moved restlessly. “What do you think might have killed \nthese men, Gared?” Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable \ncloak.\n“It was the cold,” Gared said with iron certainty. “I saw men freeze last winter, and the \n\none before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how \nthe ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold.

First you go weak and drowsy, \nand everything starts to fade, and then it’s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, \nlike.”\n“Such eloquence, Gared,” Ser Waymar observed. “I never suspected you had it in you.”\n“I’ve had the cold in me too, lordling.” Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a \ngood long look at the stumps where his ears had been. “Two ears, three toes, and the \nlittle finger off my left hand. I got off light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, \nwith a smile on his face.”\nSer Waymar shrugged. “You ought dress more warmly, Gared.”\nGared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where \nMaester Aemon had cut the ears away."

He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had \npointed it out. “They couldn’t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn’t cold \nenough.”\nRoyce nodded. “Bright lad. We’ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry \nof snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men \nclad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of \nmaking fire.” The knight’s smile was cocksure. “Will, lead us there.

Ser \nWaymar Royce came next, his great black destrier snorting impatiently. The warhorse \nwas the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. Gared brought up \nthe rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode.\nTwilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, \nthen faded to black. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for \nthe light.\n“We can make a better pace than this, surely,” Royce said when the moon was full risen.\n“Not with this horse,” Will said.

His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-\nalive.\n“There’s something wrong here,” Gared muttered.\nThe young knight gave him a disdainful smile. “Is there?”\n“Can’t you feel it?” Gared asked. “Listen to the darkness.”\nWill could feel it. Four years in the Night’s Watch, and he had never been so afraid. \nWhat was it?\n\n“Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?” When \nGared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle.

The oldest had long ago \nrusted away to nothing, leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on \nstone. Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now. He \nhoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled. In the \ncenturies before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn allegiance to no \nman, styling themselves the Kings in the North.\n\nNed stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness \nahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes \nwaiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children. Ned did not like to think on \nthat. “Here,” he told his king.\nRobert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head.\nThere were three tombs, side by side."

He wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, \nfurious that he had let them fall, and turned to go.\n“Boy,” a voice called out to him. Jon turned.\nTyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all \nthe world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. “Is that animal a wolf?”\n“A direwolf,” Jon said. “His name is Ghost.” He stared up at the little man, his \ndisappointment suddenly forgotten. “What are you doing up there? Why aren’t you at \nthe feast?”\n“Too hot, too noisy, and I’d drunk too much wine,” the dwarf told him. “I learned long \nago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother."

Jon \ngasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed \nlightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.\nGhost backed away from him uncertainly.\nThe dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. “I believe I’ve frightened your wolf. My \napologies.”\n“He’s not scared,” Jon said. He knelt and called out. “Ghost, come here. Come on. That’s \nit.”\nThe wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon’s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion \nLannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs \nin a silent snarl. “Shy, isn’t he?” Lannister observed.\n“Sit, Ghost,” Jon commanded. “That’s it. Keep still.” He looked up at the dwarf. “You can \ntouch him now. He won’t move until I tell him to. I’ve been training him."

He cocked his oversized head to \none side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. “I am Tyrion Lannister.”\n“I know,” Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel \nstrange.\n“You’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?”\nJon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing.\n“Did I offend you?” Lannister said. “Sorry. Dwarfs don’t have to be tactful.

Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. \nArmor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.”\nJon was in no mood for anyone’s counsel. “What do you know about being a bastard?”\n“All dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes.”\n“You are your mother’s trueborn son of Lannister.”\n“Am I?” the dwarf replied, sardonic. “Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing \nme, and he’s never been sure.”\n“I don’t even know who my mother was,” Jon said.\n“Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.” He favored Jon with a rueful grin. \n“Remember this, boy.

One moment he was walking \ntoward Snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground, the book \nspinning away from him as he fell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his \nmouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. As he tried to get up, his back spasmed \npainfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall.

Your brother is a \ngreat knight, and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms. Speak to \nthem for us. Tell them of our need here. You have seen for yourself, my lord. The Night’s \nWatch is dying. Our strength is less than a thousand now. Six hundred here, two \nhundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a scant third of those \nfighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that. Should an attack come, \nI have three men to defend each mile of wall."

The old man warmed his hands before the fire. “I \nsent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce’s son, lost on his first ranging. The Royce \nboy was green as summer grass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, \nsaying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish to offend his lord father, so I yielded. I \nsent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch. More fool I.”\n“Fool,” the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those \nbeady black eyes, ruffling its wings. “Fool,” it called again. Doubtless old Mormont \nwould take it amiss if he throttled the creature. A pity.\nThe Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird. “Gared was near as old as I \nam and longer on the Wall,” he went on, “yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled. \nI should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from \nWinterfell."

The Night’s Watch has become an army of \nsullen boys and tired old men. Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps \ntwenty who can read, and even fewer who can think, or plan, or lead. Once the Watch \nspent its summers building, and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he \nfound it. Now it is all we can do to stay alive.”\nHe was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized.

Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and \nimpregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. There she would find her sister . . . and, \nperhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew more than she had dared to \nput in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters \nto ruin, and if it came to war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who \nowed them service.\nYet the mountain road was perilous."

Strangers all, friendly enough \nonly a moment ago, and yet now they cried for his blood like hounds on a trail.\nTyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from his voice. “If Lady Stark believes \nI have some crime to answer for, I will go with her and answer for it.”\nIt was the only possible course. Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to \nan early grave. A good dozen swords had responded to the Stark woman’s plea for help: \nthe Harrenhal man, the three Brackens, a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as \nthough they’d kill him as soon as spit, and some fool field hands who doubtless had no \nidea what they were doing."

During one of their louder quarrels, when Catelyn was \neight, Lord Hoster had called Brynden “the black goat of the Tully flock.” Laughing, \nBrynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout, so he ought to \nbe a black fish rather than a black goat, and from that day forward he had taken it as his \npersonal emblem.\nThe war had not ended until the day she and Lysa had been wed. It was at their wedding \nfeast that Brynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and her new \nhusband, the Lord of the Eyrie. Lord Hoster had not spoken his brother’s name since, \nfrom what Edmure told her in his infrequent letters."

He took a glancing blow to the shoulder, nothing more. “Gold,” he repeated, \nscrambling backward like a crab, “more gold than you’ll see here in a lifetime. Enough to \nbuy land, women, horses . . . you could be a lord. Lord Mord.” Tyrion hawked up a glob \nof blood and phlegm and spat it out into the sky.\n“Is no gold,” Mord said.\nHe’s listening! Tyrion thought. “They relieved me of my purse when they captured me, \nbut the gold is still mine. Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner, but she’d never stoop \nto rob him."

From the lurch in his step, she could tell at once that Viserys had found his \nwine . . . and something that passed for courage.\nHe was wearing his scarlet silks, soiled and travel-stained. His cloak and gloves were \nblack velvet, faded from the sun. His boots were dry and cracked, his silver-blond hair \nmatted and tangled. A longsword swung from his belt in a leather scabbard. The \nDothraki eyed the sword as he passed; Dany heard curses and threats and angry \nmuttering rising all around her, like a tide. The music died away in a nervous \nstammering of drums.\nA sense of dread closed around her heart. “Go to him,” she commanded Ser Jorah. “Stop \nhim. Bring him here. Tell him he can have the dragon’s eggs if that is what he wants.” \nThe knight rose swiftly to his feet.\n“Where is my sister?” Viserys shouted, his voice thick with wine. “I’ve come for her feast."

For a moment his grief overwhelmed him. He wanted \nnothing so much as to seek out the godswood, to kneel before the heart tree and pray for \nthe life of Robert Baratheon, who had been more than a brother to him. Men would \nwhisper afterward that Eddard Stark had betrayed his king’s friendship and disinherited \nhis sons; he could only hope that the gods would know better, and that Robert would \nlearn the truth of it in the land beyond the grave.\nNed took out the king’s last letter. A roll of crisp white parchment sealed with golden \nwax, a few short words and a smear of blood. How small the difference between victory \nand defeat, between life and death."

No doubt Lord Stannis was wary, after the murder of Jon Arryn, but it was \n\nimperative that he sail for King’s Landing at once with all his power, before the \nLannisters could march.\nNed chose each word with care. When he was done, he signed the letter Eddard Stark, \nLord of Winterfell, Hand of the King, and Protector of the Realm, blotted the paper, \nfolded it twice, and melted the sealing wax over the candle flame.\nHis regency would be a short one, he reflected as the wax softened."

Every northerner is worth ten of \nthese southron swords, Desmond had told her. “You liar!” she said, kicking his body in a \nsudden fury.\nThe animals were restless in their stalls, whickering and snorting at the scent of blood. \nArya’s only plan was to saddle a horse and flee, away from the castle and the city. All she \nhad to do was stay on the kingsroad and it would take her back to Winterfell. She took a \nbridle and harness off the wall.\nAs she crossed in back of the wagon, a fallen chest caught her eye."

He could feel a dull ache in his shattered leg, an \nitch beneath the plaster. When he touched his thigh, the flesh was hot to his fingers. The \nonly sound was his breathing. After a time, he began to talk aloud, just to hear a voice. \nHe made plans to keep himself sane, built castles of hope in the dark. Robert’s brothers \nwere out in the world, raising armies at Dragonstone and Storm’s End."

When he did choose to make a ruling, though, not \neven his queen mother could sway him.\nA thief was brought before him and he had Ser Ilyn chop his hand off, right there in \ncourt. Two knights came to him with a dispute about some land, and he decreed that \nthey should duel for it on the morrow. “To the death,” he added. A woman fell to her \nknees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor. She had loved him, she said, \nand she wanted to see him decently buried. “If you loved a traitor, you must be a traitor \ntoo,” Joffrey said. Two gold cloaks dragged her off to the dungeons."
